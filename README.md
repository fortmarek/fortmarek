### Hi! ‚ú®

My name is Marek Fo≈ôt and I am currently a co-founder and a maintainer of [Tuist](https://tuist.io/). Before that I used a mobile engineer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). I have a passion for open-source, Swift, building _stuff_ ‚ú® - but most importantly of all, helping and talking with people!
At the moment, I live in the cool city of Berlin, so if you ever happen to visit, feel free to approach me and we can have a chat over coffee ‚òïÔ∏è

Otherwise, I am fairly active on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.online/@marekfort) and of course you can reach me via [email](marekfort@me.com), too! I am more than happy to talk about anything, it does not have to be Swift or even development-related üñ§

I try to work in the open as much as I can - you could checkout my repositories and latest activity to see what I am working on.

If you want to get to know more about me and read my blog posts, check out my **[personal website](https://marekfort.com/)**
